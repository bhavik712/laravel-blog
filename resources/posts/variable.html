    I have briefly discussed about Variable.
    <li>
        A variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable
    </li>
    <li>
        A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
    </li>
    <li>A variable name cannot start with a number</li>
    <li>
        A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and
        underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
    </li>
    <li>
        Variable names are case-sensitive ($age and $AGE are two different
        variables)
    </li>
